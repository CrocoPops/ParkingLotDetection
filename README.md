Parking lot analysis is an algorithm designed for detecting and classifying park-
ing spaces. It processes each image in a parking lot dataset, identifying and
classifying both occupied and unoccupied parking spaces, as well as detecting
and classifying cars within and outside the parking areas. The algorithm also
visualizes the parking lotâ€™s status on a map.
To run the code, simply enter './ParkingLot analysis' in the terminal. To
save the result images and metrics, use the command './ParkingLot analysis
--save'. All files will be stored in the results folder.
